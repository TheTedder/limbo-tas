# LIMBO TAS

This TAS is performed on the DRM-free linux build of LIMBO. It will not sync on the Steam version. Since the game itself is a 32-bit executable, it must be TASed using the 32-bit version of libTAS. The game resolution and settings must not be altered, except for the enabling of windowed mode. The goal of the TAS is to reach the credits as fast as possible, starting from a fresh install.
